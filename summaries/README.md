Provenance of the Mira dataset:

1. `alcf-tokio-results-2_14_17-2_15_18.csv` (md5: `3ebc32d7d3d1f8d8ee445d8a3d12dbba`) generated by
   Shane Snyder and delivered to NERSC for inclusion in the repository on Feb 16, 2018
2. Three malformed rows all dropped, indices kept
3. fshealth data was joined into the CSV from mmdf/mmlsdisk dumps collected on Mira.  Unsure where
   the script that did this is now located (in tokio-abc?); can track it down if necessary.
4. ggiostat data for February/March, which was zero in the Feb 16, 2018 dataset, was recovered from
   the PDSW dataset and joined to the Feb 16, 2018 dataset.  Unsure where the script that did this
   is now located.
5. The Mira `_datetime_start` and `_datetime_end` strings were converted to epoch time stamps, but
   mistakenly assuming that the strings reflected `America/Los_Angeles` time zone instead of
   `America/Chicago`.

Each augmentation of the CSV-based dataset required deserializing from ASCII and reserializing to
ASCII via pandas.  This resulted in some loss of precision on floating point values that were 
otherwise unmodified.

NERSC datasets did not require any hand modification.  The process by which they were generated is
described in README.md at the top level of this repository.
